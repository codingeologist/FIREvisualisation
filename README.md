# Welcome to FIRE visualisation webapp!

Hi, this is my little project for web visualisation and local database management with CRUD. I have used my python, HTML, CSS (mainly bootstrap), Flask module, SQLalchemy and Plolty.


# Things to do

1. Replace password with password hash
2. align graphs in nice grid form (I was banging my head with aligning with bootstrap)
3. Create requirement.txt. Fortunately, pythonanywhere has built-in modules installed, so I did not install or specify and modules.
4. Write clean code

# NOTES 

## TODO
1. Make sqlite database persistent.
2. Refactor login pipeline.
3. Refactor database, user analysis classes.
4. Dockerise app.
